# Hi there, I'm David ðŸ¦§

I am David, and I develop software. Mainly I work in the JVM and static typed. But I also like TypeScript a lot.  
Whether I use an object-oriented or more functional approach depends on the application domain and other factors.  
My mindset is agile. I would like to develop software in its entirety. Test and Behaviour Driven Development are the tools of my choice.  
I work best with teams that share this mindset, with people with whom I can learn new things well: people who like to learn and/or who like to share their knowledge.
